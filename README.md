A PostHog plugin to convert specific url search/query parameters to event properties allowing you to more easily compare them in insights.

By default, this converts no parameter at all. By white listing parameters the plugin will look for those and convert to properties

Support [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) and give it a try today.
